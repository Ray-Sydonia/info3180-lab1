 <h1>Rayna Jarrett</h1>
 <p>My name is Rayna Jarret, as stated in the title and I attend the University of the West Indies.<br>
I am a pretty fast learner and I'm always taking up hobbies. I learnt how to crochet and Knit from<br> 
watching Youtube videos and have many quite a few items.I also like to watch television shows and read <br>
books, as they provide an escape from the stresses of this world. I'm trying my hand in Computer Science<br>
after doing the sciences (chemistry,biology and physics) my whole highschool life. Why you ask, well who<br>
know but lets see where this goes.Truly though I was interested in the Dynamic Web Development course because<br>
as demonstrated through my hobbies I like to express my creativity and I see web development and design as a<br>
to a way to create efficent (and aesthetic) websites. While the back end of computing is also also interesting<br>
and quite an important skill to have, I find the web development more engaging.</p>
